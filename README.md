1. I began by implementing the authentication system using JWT tokens, enabling secure Sign In and Sign Up functionality. After that, I developed the frontend interface, creating separate access views for both admin and regular users.

2. On the backend, I set up API routes using Express and connected the application to MongoDB. I assigned admin privileges to the email shubhankarrai007@gmail.com, while all other users were given standard access.

3. Next, I implemented full CRUD operations integrated with MongoDB, allowing dynamic data management across the platform. Finally, I refined the frontend design using Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean and aesthetic user experience.

4. Tech Stack ->
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS  
Backend: Node.js, Express  
Database: MongoDB  
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)  
Full Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
